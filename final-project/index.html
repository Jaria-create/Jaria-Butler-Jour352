                <h2>
                    The health benefits of owning pets have been realized for years. The companionship, affection and
                    unconditional love they provide can make owners happier and less stressed. A 2015 study in the
                    Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine, reported that owning a pet could “decrease stress,
                    blood pressure, anxiety levels and depression symptoms."

                    <h3>What Is an Emotional Support Animal (ESA)?</h3>
                    <p>An emotional support animal (ESA) is any domesticated animal that provides a psychological and/or emotional benefit to its owner.

“If a person is about to spiral or head into a bad feeling, sometimes just holding the animal can calm them down,” Morrissette says. “Having that animal beside them can prevent them from going to a worse [mental] place.”

Being officially trained is not a requirement for ESAs, but in some cases can help them better serve you, Many ESAs haven’t been trained at all—their mere presence is enough for someone to reap the psychological benefits.</p>

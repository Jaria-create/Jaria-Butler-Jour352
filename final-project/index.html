                                The health benefits of owning pets have been realized for years. The companionship,
                                affection and unconditional love they provide can make owners happier and less stressed.
                                A 2015 study in the Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine, reported that
                                owning a pet could “decrease stress, blood pressure, anxiety levels and depression
                                symptoms.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When someone has an animal that helps alleviate symptoms of their mental illness, it’s
                                referred to as an emotional support animal.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “Emotional support animals provide comfort and companionship to a person with a mental
                                disability,” explains Julie Morrissette, a training consultant at Service Dog Training
                                School International, an online service dog training school.

                            <h4>What Is an Emotional Support Animal (ESA)?</h4>
                            <p>
                                An emotional support animal (ESA) is any domesticated animal that provides a
                                psychological and/or emotional benefit to its owner.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                “If a person is about to spiral or head into a bad feeling, sometimes just holding the
                                animal can calm them down,” Morrissette says. “Having that animal beside them can
                                prevent them from going to a worse [mental] place.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Being officially trained is not a requirement for ESAs, but in some cases can help them
                                better serve you, Many ESAs haven’t been trained at all—their mere presence is enough
                                for someone to reap the psychological benefits.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The main difference between emotional support animals, service dogs and therapy dogs is
                                their level of training, legal access to public spaces and ability to complete tasks.

                                Service dogs: These are dogs trained to complete specific tasks that help their owners
                                with their day-to-day activities. “Service dogs are almost like medicine with four legs
                                and a tail because they’re needed to function daily,” explains Morrissette. They don’t
                                have to be certified, and it’s against the law for someone working at a business or
                                government facility to ask for a service dog’s documentation, as per the ADA.
                                Additionally, service dogs are allowed by law to enter public areas.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Therapy dogs: These are dogs used for companionship and comfort, just like ESAs, except
                                they have undergone extensive training and socialization for this purpose. You may see
                                them used in senior centers, schools, libraries and hospitals. “A therapy dog has to
                                have a very calm temperament…It needs to be well-trained, well-behaved, socialized and
                                able to listen to instructions very well,” explains Morrissette.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Emotional support animals (ESAs): These animals mainly offer comfort and companionship
                                to those dealing with mental health disorders. They’re not trained in tasks and don’t
                                have the legal right to be in public spaces. ESAs are not limited to dogs; any
                                domesticated animal, such as cats, mice, rabbits, birds, rats, miniature horses and more
                                can be considered an ESA.

                            <h6>How To Get an Emotional Support Animal?</h6>
                            <p>
                                If you already live with an animal that benefits your mental health and are seeing a
                                licensed mental health professional, you can ask them to write you an ESA letter to
                                prove that it’s crucial to your well-being.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The process differs if you don’t currently have an animal and are looking to get one.
                                You’ll want to select an animal that best suits your mental and emotional needs; most
                                people select dogs. The next step will be to obtain an ESA letter from your licensed
                                mental health professional.

                            <h7> What’s an ESA Letter? and Eligibility for ESA Animals </h7>
                            <p>
                                An ESA letter is the only legally accepted way to prove that your pet is an emotional
                                support animal. You must retrieve the letter from a physician or licensed mental health
                                professional, including a therapist, psychiatrist or psychologist. The letter confirms
                                that you’re dealing with a diagnosed mental illness and that your pet is providing you
                                with mental and/or emotional benefits. However, there are several places where ESA
                                letters aren’t accepted. This is because, unlike service dogs, emotional support animals
                                aren’t protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). It’s up to each
                                individual business, such as restaurants and retail stores, to accept or deny your ESA.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                To qualify for an emotional support animal, you must be suffering from a diagnosed
                                mental illness or disability, such as depression, anxiety or post-traumatic stress
                                disorder. Your licensed mental health professional or doctor must recognize that your
                                ESA provides you with a psychological and/or emotional benefit.

                            <h8>Can Emotional Support Dogs Fly on Airlines?</h8>
                            <p>
                                Prior to 2021, emotional support animals were able to fly on airlines for free with
                                their owner. But due to a change in the Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA), airlines are no
                                longer required to accept ESAs. Emotional support dogs are only allowed in the cabin on
                                most airlines if they meet the size requirements and the owner pays the pet fee.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If your ESA doesn’t meet the size requirements, it may have to fly in the plane’s cargo
                                hold or it may not be allowed to fly at all.
